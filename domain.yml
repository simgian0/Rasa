  utter_fight_explained:
    - text: |
        Now you will fight a monster, choosing from 3 different options:
        
        - Continue fighting - This will roll a 20 faces die in order to see if you win the combat or not.
          To win you have to roll an equal or higher number of the difficulty. 
          If you are a fighter, the difficulty will be reduced if you are strong enough.
          If you are a spellcaster, you can cast spells to reduce the difficulty.

        - Cast spell - This will present you the spell list associated with your character, if you are a spellcaster.
          You can cast a maximum of 3 spells per combat before finishing your magic energies, so choose wisely!
          You can also see what a spell can do by typing 'Tell me about the spell NAME-SPELL (e.g. Fireball)' 

        - Run away - If you think the fight is too difficult to beat, you can always return to the city and try fighting another monster!  
  utter_main_menu_explained:
    - text: |
        This is the Main Menu of the adventure, where you can do several things with your character. For example you can:
        
        - Talk with an NPC, a Non Playable Character, who will give you some info about the tales surrounding the city you are exploring.
          The NPC could also be a Mechant who will sell you items that you could buy, given that you have enough gold :D.

        - Explore the city, where you will uncover the misteries of the city you are in!.

        - Go to Adventure, where you will fight a dangerous monster for the life. 
          If you win, you'll receive a prize, according to the monster difficulty, which will grant you gold to buy more items. 
          If you lose, you will not gain anything, but be careful: if you are defeated 3 times, you will lose your character and you will have to restart everything!
        
        You will discover the rest by playing!
